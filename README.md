# House Prices Prediction

This repository contains a Kaggle notebook analyzing the Ames Housing dataset and predicting house prices using an ensemble of Lasso, Ridge, LightGBM, and XGBoost models. The notebook emphasizes **storytelling**, transforming raw data into insights, and exploring the features that drive housing prices.

## Project Overview
Imagine you’re on a quest to find your dream home. You might think the price depends on bedrooms or a white picket fence. But in reality, home prices are influenced by dozens of factors: the quality of construction, number of bathrooms, neighborhood, and even whether the house has recently been remodeled.

In this project, we explore the Ames Housing dataset—where each house tells a story. We perform:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Skewness correction and feature scaling
- Model building (Lasso, Ridge, LightGBM, XGBoost)
- Model ensembling for improved predictions

## Dataset
The dataset is from [Kaggle: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

**Dataset size:**  
- Training set: 1,460 rows, 80 columns  
- Test set: 1,459 rows, 79 columns
